# r-playground
Personal playground for RStudio related projects. You can join in and use anything you want. :)

28/08/20: uploaded my first script, "distribution.mean.R". It computes and plots the means of n replicates of a random normal sample of size N, then plots the normal distribution of the mean, the calculated values and a kernel density estimator for them.
